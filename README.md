- I thought my first challenge submission was made like [this](https://bsky.app/profile/pumaparded.bsky.social/post/3jzpgicbgza27)
- Which is a still from a shader passed into blender, baked then passed back into a shader.
- So I took stills from my first OP [sketch](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1575927)
- Baked [those](https://bsky.app/profile/pumaparded.bsky.social/post/3lc3h644ag22y)
- Loaded it as a texture into R3f, passed the texture to the vertex shader and used that to distort.
- Passed a texture into the vertex and messed it up a bit.
- Cheecked & turned out my first submissions were actually from this [bot](https://x.com/neurot483/status/1592473053836890116)
- That used python and a font file filled with random shapes to draw to canvas.
- No way I was writting recreational python so I'm glad I misremembered.
